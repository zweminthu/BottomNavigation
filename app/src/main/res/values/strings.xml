    <string name="set_fire_to_the_rain_lyrics">[Verse 1] I let it fall, my heart And as it fell, you rose to claim it It was dark, and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they were strong But my knees were far too weak To stand in your arms Without falling to your feet [Pre-Chorus] But there\'s a side to you That I never knew, never knew All the things you\'d say They were never true, never true And the games you\'d play You would always win, always win [Chorus] But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I cried \'Cause I heard it screamin\' out your name Your name [Verse 2] When I lay with you I could stay there, close my eyes Feel you here forever You and me together, nothing is better [Pre-Chorus] \'Cause there\'s a side to you That I never knew, never knew All the things you\'d say They were never true, never true And the games you\'d play You would always win, always win You might also like GOD DID DJ Khaled

name I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames When it fell, somethin\' died \'Cause I knew that that was the last time The last time [Bridge] Sometimes, I wake up by the door That heart you caught must be waitin\' for you Even now, when we\'re already over I can\'t help myself from lookin\' for you [Chorus] I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I cried \'Cause I heard it screamin\' out your name Your name I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames When it fell, somethin\' died \'Cause I knew that that was the last time The last time [Outro] Oh Oh, no Let it burn Oh Let it burn Let it burn [Verse 1] I let it fall, my heart And as it fell, you rose to claim it It was dark, and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you
